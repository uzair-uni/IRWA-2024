# IRWA-2024

This is the first deliverable and first part of the project of Information retrieval and web analytics. 

##Contents

This deliverable contains a pdf report with the description of the work done and justifications for our decitions at the time of processing the data.
It also contains the python notebook with all the code used to process and analyse the data provided.

##Usage

To use this project simply download the .ipynb file, and open it with any program that supports it. Before running all cells it is very important to go to the data loading cell (4th cell) and change the doc path to your own route to the farmers-protest-tweets.json file.

Once this is done, to see every part of the work just run all cells in order, the code is commented so that everything that happens is understandable and can be followed.
