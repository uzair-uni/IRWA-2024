##Contents

This deliverable contains the python notebook with all the code used to process and analyse the data provided.

##Usage

To use this project simply download the .ipynb file in the corresponding tag and open it with any program that supports it. Before running all cells it is very important to go to the data loading cells and change the doc path to your own input files.

Once this is done, to see every part of the work just run all cells in order, the code is commented so that everything that happens is understandable and can be followed.
